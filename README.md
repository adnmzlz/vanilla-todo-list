First time using TypeScript.

<hr>

*Current features:*
- Add a task
- Mark a task as completed
- Delete a task
- Restore a deleted task
- All tasks saved to local storage

*Upcoming features:*
- Change task order
- Filter by completed

*I'm going to be re-making this again from scratch in React as well.  I have some more features I want to include, but they might see the light of day until the rebuild:*
- Logins/users/auth
- Saving tasks to a database
- Make it look nicer

*Offshoots I want to try based on this idea:*
- Save to a database, but no individual users.  Everyone has to share the same list (Asana gone wild).
- Ways to view/share tasks with others.
