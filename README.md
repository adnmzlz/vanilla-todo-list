<strong>I'm going to be re-making this again from scratch in React as well.  I have some more features I want to include, but they might see the light of day until the rebuild:</strong>
- Logins/users/auth
- Saving tasks to a database

<strong>Offshoots I want to try based on this idea:</strong>
- Save to a database, but no individual users.  Everyone has to share the same list (Asana gone wild).
- Ways to view/share tasks with others.
