First time using TypeScript.

<hr>

<strong>Current features:</strong>
- Add a task
- Mark a task as completed
- Delete a task
- Restore a deleted task
- All tasks saved to local storage

*v1.1.0 release*
- Change task order

<strong>Upcoming features:</strong>
- Filter by completed

<strong>I'm going to be re-making this again from scratch in React as well.  I have some more features I want to include, but they might see the light of day until the rebuild:</strong>
- Logins/users/auth
- Saving tasks to a database
- Make it look nicer

<strong>Offshoots I want to try based on this idea:</strong>
- Save to a database, but no individual users.  Everyone has to share the same list (Asana gone wild).
- Ways to view/share tasks with others.
